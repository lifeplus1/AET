# Product: Rodin Coil

## Educational Description

The Rodin Coil is a toroidal winding device based on Marko Rodin's Vortex-Based Mathematics, a system that explores numerical patterns mirroring universal structures. This coil is wound following the sequence 1-2-4-8-7-5, creating a unique electromagnetic field that enthusiasts use to study resonance and energy flow.

### Key Principles

- **Toroidal Design**: Confines magnetic fields efficiently, reducing energy loss.
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Aligns with natural patterns, as discussed in our blog posts on Rodin Coils (Spiritual and Practical Perspectives).
- **Potential Uses**: Ideal for DIY experiments in electromagnetism or as a meditative tool for energy alignment.

### Specifications

- Material: Copper wire on a non-conductive frame.
- Size: Approximately 6-8 inches in diameter (variations available).
- Note: This is a passive device; no power source included. For educational purposes only.
