## Detailed Structure

### Home Page

- Hero Section: “Exploring energy, consciousness, and ascension through education and tools.”
- Featured Blog Posts: Rotate to include *Casimir Effect*, *Tesla Coil*, *Rodin Coils (Spiritual)*.
  - *Casimir Effect* teaser: “Discover how the quantum vacuum exerts real forces, bridging science and ascension.”
- Store Highlights: Crystals, Jewelry, Ascension Tools with educational context (e.g., “Crystals for vibrational resonance, inspired by quantum principles”).
- Call to Action: “Read the Blog” or “Explore Tools.”

### Blog Section

- Blog Home: List of all posts with search/filter by category.
  - New Category: *Quantum Phenomena* (includes *Casimir Effect*, *Zero-Point Energy Devices*, *Vacuum Charge Clusters*).
  - *Casimir Effect* Post: Located at /blog/casimir-effect, cross-referenced in *Zero-Point Energy Devices* and *Rodin Coils* posts.
    - Links to Store: “Explore crystals or Rodin Coils in our store to experiment with resonance.”
- Categories:
  - Historical Innovations (e.g., Tesla Coil, Keely’s SVP)
  - Modern Applications (e.g., PEMF Devices, Rife Machines)
  - Spiritual Perspectives (e.g., Rodin Coils Spiritual, Crystal Grids Spiritual)
  - Quantum Phenomena (new, with Casimir Effect)

### Store Section

- Store Home: Categories with educational descriptions.
  - **Crystals**: Quartz, Amethyst, etc., linked to *Crystal-Grid Technologies* and *Casimir Effect* posts for piezoelectric context.
  - **Jewelry**: Pendants, bracelets, tied to biofield concepts.
  - **Ascension Tools**: Rodin Coils, ABHA Torus, Starship Coil, Elementals, with links to relevant blog posts (e.g., *Casimir Effect* for Rodin Coils’ resonance).
- Cart/Checkout: Simple integration (PayPal/Stripe).
- Product Pages: Include educational notes (e.g., Rodin Coil page references *Casimir Effect* for quantum resonance parallels).

### About Page

- Mission: Emphasize education over sales, now noting the inclusion of quantum topics like the Casimir Effect.
- Inventory: Mention crystals and ascension tools as educational aids.

### Contact Page

- Form: Unchanged, for inquiries about blog topics or store items.
- Additional: Optional social links for community engagement.

### Resources Page

- Glossary: Add “Casimir Effect: A quantum phenomenon where vacuum fluctuations create an attractive force between uncharged plates.”
- External Links: Include quantum physics resources (e.g., Casimir’s 1948 paper, nanotechnology journals).
- Downloads: Add a PDF infographic on quantum vacuum energy, referencing the Casimir Effect.

## Technical Notes

- **Platform**: WordPress with WooCommerce or static HTML/CSS for minimal maintenance.
- **SEO**: Add meta tags for “Casimir Effect,” “quantum vacuum,” “zero-point energy.”
- **Integration**: Embed blog links in store (e.g., Rodin Coil page links to *Casimir Effect*) and store links in blog (e.g., end of *Casimir Effect* post).
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-friendly design, alt text for placeholder images.

This sitemap ensures the *Casimir Effect* post enhances the site’s educational depth while integrating with existing content and inventory.
