# Vortex-Based Mathematics Devices: The Power of Numerical Patterns

## Introduction to Vortex-Based Mathematics
Vortex-Based Mathematics (VBM), developed by Marko Rodin, is a numerical system that claims to reveal universal patterns through a repeating sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5). Devices based on VBM, such as Rodin Coils and ABHA Torus, are explored for their energy and consciousness applications, fitting *Ascension Energy Technologies*’ innovative ethos.

## Mathematical Principles
VBM posits that numbers form a toroidal vortex, mirroring cosmic and biological patterns. Key concepts include:
- **Numerical Cycle**: The sequence creates a harmonic loop, aligning with natural resonances.
- **Geometric Applications**: Used to design coils, toroids, and other devices with enhanced energy flow.
- **Universal Connection**: VBM is said to encode the structure of reality, from DNA to galaxies.

## Historical Context
Rodin’s work in the late 20th century popularized VBM, influencing alternative energy and spiritual communities. His devices aim to physicalize these mathematical principles.

## Applications
- **Energy Devices**: Coils and toroids explore electromagnetic efficiency and novel energy generation.
- **Spiritual Practices**: Used in meditation to align with universal harmonics.
- **Education**: Demonstrates mathematical patterns in alternative science curricula.

## Considerations
VBM’s claims are speculative, with limited mainstream validation. Experimental devices require careful construction and testing.

## Legacy and Exploration
VBM devices inspire exploration of mathematics as a universal language, bridging science and metaphysics.
