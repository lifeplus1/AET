# Dr. Peter Gariaev’s Wave Genetics: DNA and Information Fields

## Introduction to Wave Genetics
Dr. Peter Gariaev’s wave genetics proposes that DNA communicates via electromagnetic and acoustic waves, carrying information that influences biology and consciousness. This field intrigues *Ascension Energy Technologies* for its potential to transform health and awareness.

## Scientific Principles
Wave genetics suggests:
- **DNA as a Bio-Computer**: DNA stores and transmits information via waves.
- **Wave Communication**: Electromagnetic and acoustic signals influence genetic expression.
- **Healing Potential**: Wave-based interventions could reprogram DNA for health.

## Historical Context
Gariaev’s work in the 1990s built on Russian biophysics, gaining attention in alternative science for its radical implications.

## Applications
- **Healing**: Explored for non-invasive genetic therapies.
- **Consciousness**: Investigated for its impact on awareness and intuition.
- **Research**: Studied in bioelectromagnetics and quantum biology.

## Considerations
Wave genetics is highly speculative, with limited empirical support. Ethical and safety concerns arise in genetic applications.

## Legacy and Exploration
Gariaev’s work challenges conventional genetics, inspiring exploration of DNA’s energetic role.

## Further Exploration
Read Gariaev’s papers, join quantum biology forums, or explore wave-based healing modalities.
