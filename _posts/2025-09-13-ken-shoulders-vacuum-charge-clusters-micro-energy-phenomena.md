# Ken Shoulders’ Vacuum Charge Clusters: Micro-Energy Phenomena

## Introduction to Vacuum Charge Clusters
Ken Shoulders’ vacuum charge clusters, or Exotic Vacuum Objects (EVOs), are microscopic, high-energy plasma structures with potential applications in energy and propulsion. This niche field intrigues *Ascension Energy Technologies* for its unconventional approach to physics.

## Scientific Principles
EVOs are self-organized plasma clusters formed in high-voltage discharges. Key aspects include:
- **Charge Concentration**: Microscopic clusters carry intense energy.
- **Potential Applications**: Explored for energy generation or propulsion.
- **Quantum Effects**: May interact with quantum vacuum energy.

## Historical Context
Shoulders’ work in the late 20th century built on plasma physics, gaining interest in fringe science for its radical implications.

## Applications
- **Energy Research**: Investigated for compact power sources.
- **Propulsion**: Explored for micro-thruster technologies.
- **Physics Studies**: Advances understanding of plasma and quantum phenomena.

## Considerations
EVOs are experimental, with limited validation. High-voltage experiments require strict safety measures.

## Legacy and Exploration
Shoulders’ work pushes the boundaries of plasma physics, inspiring innovation in micro-energy systems.

## Further Exploration
Study Shoulders’ papers, join plasma physics communities, or explore EVO experiments with caution.
