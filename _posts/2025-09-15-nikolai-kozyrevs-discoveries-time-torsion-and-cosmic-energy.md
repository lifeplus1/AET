# Nikolai Kozyrev’s Discoveries: Time, Torsion, and Cosmic Energy

## Introduction to Kozyrev’s Work
Nikolai Kozyrev, a Russian astrophysicist, proposed that time is an active energy field influencing physical systems. His discoveries, including torsion fields and time manipulation, intrigue alternative researchers and align with *Ascension Energy Technologies*’ exploratory mission.

## Scientific Principles
Kozyrev’s theories include:
- **Time as Energy**: Time flows like a field, affecting matter and energy.
- **Torsion Fields**: Spiral energy fields generated by spinning objects, influencing physical systems.
- **Experimental Evidence**: Kozyrev’s devices, like gyroscopes, detected subtle energy changes.

## Historical Context
Kozyrev’s work in the mid-20th century faced Soviet suppression but gained interest in fringe science for its implications in energy and consciousness.

## Applications
- **Energy Research**: Torsion fields explored for novel energy systems.
- **Consciousness Studies**: Investigated for their impact on human awareness.
- **Physics**: Inspires alternative models of time and energy.

## Considerations
Kozyrev’s theories are speculative, with limited mainstream validation. Experimental safety is critical.

## Legacy and Exploration
Kozyrev’s work challenges conventional physics, encouraging exploration of time and energy’s deeper nature.

## Further Exploration
