# Slim Spurling’s Elementals: Tools for Energetic Harmony

## Introduction to Elementals
Slim Spurling’s Elementals are a collection of devices, including Tensor Rings and other geometric tools, designed to harmonize energy fields and enhance environmental and personal well-being. Part of the *Ascension Energy Technologies* inventory, these tools are rooted in Spurling’s research into subtle energies and sacred geometry, offering both spiritual and practical applications.

## Principles and Design
Elementals, such as Acu-Vac Coils and Harmonizers, use specific geometries and materials (often copper) to create coherent energy fields. Key features include:
- **Energy Balancing**: Elementals are said to neutralize harmful energies, such as electromagnetic pollution, and restore balance.
- **Geometric Resonance**: Designs incorporate sacred geometry to align with natural harmonics.
- **Spiritual Connection**: Used to enhance meditation, healing, and environmental harmony.

## Historical Context
Spurling developed Elementals in the 1990s, combining dowsing, metaphysics, and engineering. His work focused on addressing environmental challenges and promoting holistic well-being.

## Applications
- **Environmental Clearing**: Used to reduce electromagnetic interference or enhance agricultural yields.
- **Spiritual Practices**: Employed in meditation or energy work to support personal growth.
- **Healing Modalities**: Integrated into alternative therapies to promote energetic balance.

## Considerations
Effects are subjective, and scientific validation is limited. Safe handling of materials is essential, especially in powered applications.

## Legacy and Exploration
Elementals inspire exploration of subtle energies, offering tools for those seeking harmony in both physical and spiritual realms.

## Further Exploration
Explore Spurling’s books, connect with holistic communities, or experiment with Elementals to discover their potential in your practice.
