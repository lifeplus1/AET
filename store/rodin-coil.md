  <h1>Rodin Coil</h1>
  
## Educational Description
  
  The Rodin Coil is a toroidal winding device based on Marko Rodin's Vortex-Based Mathematics, a system that explores numerical patterns mirroring universal structures. This coil is wound following the sequence 1-2-4-8-7-5, creating a unique electromagnetic field that enthusiasts use to study resonance and energy flow.

### Key Principles
  
- **Toroidal Design**: Confines magnetic fields efficiently, reducing energy loss.
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Aligns with natural patterns, as discussed in our blog posts on Rodin Coils (Spiritual and Practical Perspectives).
- **Potential Uses**: Ideal for DIY experiments in electromagnetism or as a meditative tool for energy alignment.

### Specifications
  
- **Material**: Copper wire on a non-conductive frame
- **Size**: Approximately 6-8 inches in diameter (variations available)
- **Weight**: Lightweight, portable design
- **Note**: This is a passive device; no power source included. For educational purposes only.

### Educational Value
  
  This Rodin Coil serves as a hands-on tool for exploring the principles discussed in our blog posts. Whether you're investigating electromagnetic fields, studying Vortex-Based Mathematics, or simply curious about alternative energy concepts, this coil provides a tangible way to engage with these fascinating ideas.
